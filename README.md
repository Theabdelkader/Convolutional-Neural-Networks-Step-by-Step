# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Step-by-Step
Implementing convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and backward propagation. 

# From Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera tasks.

## implementing the building blocks of a convolutional neural network!
- Convolution functions, including:
    - Zero Padding
    - Convolve window 
    - Convolution forward
    - Convolution backward (optional)
- Pooling functions, including:
    - Pooling forward
    - Create mask 
    - Distribute value
    - Pooling backward (optional)
